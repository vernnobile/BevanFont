<p>Bevan is a reworking of a traditional slab serif display typeface created by Heinrich Jost in the 1930s. In Bevan, Jost's earlier letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers.</p>

<p>Bevan Stencil is a stencil variant on the original Bevan font to include bridges to all islands in the glyph set, to make the font usable for real-world stencils, paramilitary and industrial motifs and star-ship hulls.<p>
